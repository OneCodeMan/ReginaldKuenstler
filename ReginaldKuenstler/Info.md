The fucking thing I was stuck on (using a populated map to analyze my image with Vibrant which kept being empty) 
was just a matter of changing `@State` to `@Published` on a ViewModel property. Fuck.

On deck:
- Combine the view/functionality that gets the image input with the view/functionality for analyzing it and spitting back results out
- Make it flow better.

Then later user can create their own palette.

Started the project today.
Next thing I'm curious about is how to take in image as user input.

later on, it'll be things like...
how to use userdefaults or swiftdata to store custom palette
